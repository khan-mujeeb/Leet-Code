|[Peak element in mountain array](https://github.com/khan-mujeeb/Leet-Code/tree/main/Peak%20element%20in%20mountain%20array)|Given an integer array arr that is guaranteed to be a mountain, return any i such that arr[0] < arr[1] < ... arr[i - 1] < arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1].|[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/)|
|[First and Last Position of an Element In Sorted Array](https://github.com/khan-mujeeb/Leet-Code/tree/main/Peak%20element%20in%20mountain%20array)|You have been given a sorted array/list ARR consisting of ‘N’ elements. You are also given an integer ‘K’.Now, your task is to find the first and last occurrence of ‘K’ in ARR.|[Link](https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/problems/first-and-last-position-of-an-element-in-sorted-array_1082549?source=youtube&campaign=love_babbar_codestudio2&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=love_babbar_codestudio2&leftPanelTab=0)|
|[Search In Rotated Sorted Array](https://github.com/khan-mujeeb/Leet-Code/tree/main/Search%20In%20Rotated%20Sorted%20Array)|You have been given a sorted array/list ARR consisting of ‘N’ elements. You are also given an integer ‘K’.Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. For example, if ARR = [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 8]. Then after rotating ARR at index 3, the array will be ARR = [7, 8, 1, 3, 5].Now, your task is to find the index at which ‘K’ is present in ARR.|[Link](https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array_1082554?source=youtube&campaign=love_babbar_codestudio2&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=love_babbar_codestudio2&leftPanelTab=0)|
|[Remove Duplicate from sorted array](https://github.com/khan-mujeeb/Leet-Code/tree/main/Remove%20Duplicates%20from%20Sorted%20Array)|, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.|[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)|
|[Sqrt](https://github.com/khan-mujeeb/Leet-Code/tree/main/sqrt)|Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.|[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)|

Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.|[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)|
|[Search Insert Position](https://github.com/khan-mujeeb/Leet-Code/tree/main/Search%20Insert%20Postion)|Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.|[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)|
|[Move Zeros](https://github.com/khan-mujeeb/Leet-Code/tree/main/Move%20Zeros)|Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.|[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)|
|[Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://github.com/khan-mujeeb/Leet-Code/tree/main/Two%20Sum%20II%20-%20Input%20Array%20Is%20Sorted)|Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length|[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)|
|[Middle of LinkedList](https://github.com/khan-mujeeb/Leet-Code/tree/main/Middle%20of%20Linked%20List)|Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.|[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)|

|[Goal Parser Interpretation](https://github.com/khan-mujeeb/Leet-Code/tree/main/Goal%20Parser%20Interpretation)|You own a Goal Parser that can interpret a string command. The command consists of an alphabet of "G", "()" and/or "(al)" in some order. The Goal Parser will interpret "G" as the string "G", "()" as the string "o", and "(al)" as the string "al". The interpreted strings are then concatenated in the original order.|[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/goal-parser-interpretation/)|
